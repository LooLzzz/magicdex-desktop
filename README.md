# Magic the Gathering Card Detector

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
**This project is a WIP**

## Info

This project is currently only aimed at locating cards in an image/video and then labeling it with it's name.  
The project utilizes [perceptual hashing](https://www.phash.org/) in order to determine which card is which.

The end goal is to create a web application which can be used to monitor each player's collection.

This project is at it's very beginning, there is so much more to come.

## Acknowledgements

* [Scryfall's api](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) is a magical tool for gathering information about cards. (pun intended)

* Some code was taken from a different [project](https://github.com/hj3yoo/mtg_card_detector) as a placeholder until I implement my own card detection system.
